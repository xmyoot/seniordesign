# Senior Design - ROS-Based Robotics Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the codebase and resources for a senior design project focusing on robotics using the Robot Operating System (ROS). The project is designed to run on the Ubuntu operating system, specifically tailored for the Raspberry Pi platform.

## Project Features

- **ROS Integration:** The project leverages the power of ROS, a flexible framework for writing robot software. ROS provides tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the development of complex robotic systems.

- **Ubuntu Operating System:** The codebase is optimized for the Ubuntu operating system, ensuring compatibility and seamless execution on the Raspberry Pi platform.

- **Raspberry Pi Platform:** The project is specifically designed and tested for the Raspberry Pi, harnessing its capabilities for robotics applications.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`src/` Directory:** Contains the source code for the ROS project, organized into logical modules and packages.

- **`docs/` Directory:** Houses project documentation, including guides, specifications, and any relevant project-related information.

- **`config/` Directory:** Stores configuration files, parameters, and any setup files necessary for the project.

- **`resources/` Directory:** Contains additional resources such as CAD models, datasheets, or any supplementary materials.
